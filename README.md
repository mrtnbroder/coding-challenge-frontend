# Vimcar

Vimcar is a Berlin based IoT (internet of things) startup which provides exiting "connected cars" services for companies and endusers. You can find much more interesting facts on our website: http://vimcar.de

We are looking for a great **Frontend Developer** to join our team and work on our client side browser applications (based on Express, Flux and React).

## Frontend Developer Coding Challange
Thank you very much for applying and your interest in Vimcar. To get to know you a little better, show your skills and join our frontend coding challenge. 

### A "Reason" Management Tool
Have a look at this full featured (create, delete, search) click dummy of a "reason" management tool. Something that could be required in our browser based logbook management app, where users can assign trips to a specific category and reason.

### Your Task

Create a full functional JavaScript application (preferably using Flux and React) which looks exactly like the click dummy and provides the same functionality:
- create new reasons
- delete existing reasons
- search for existing reasons
- hovering over a reason shows the full text

You don't need to connect the app to an external API, just use localStorage to persist and search the created reasons.

### What we'd like to see
- clear, structured, consistent code that follows best practices
- a pixel perfect implementation of the click dummy

### This would really impress us (but is optional)
- a full build stack with Gulp or Grunt
- pre-processed CSS (SASS or LESS)
- responsive design
- tests
