Then start development with

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

## Production Build

Compile build files with

```shell
$ npm run build
```

Then run production server with

```shell
$ npm start
```

## O CSS, Where Art Thou?

There's no CSS (except, material design icons from the google cdn). It's all inline-styles enhanced with [Radium](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium). I want my components to be shareable. There are [quite some reasons why CSS is bad.](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js)

## Tests? Hello?

No tests added here as well, I have a special opinion about writing tests, especially within a startup. I'll explain this when we meet :).
