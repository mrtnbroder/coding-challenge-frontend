Vimcar is a connected car startup, based in Berlin and backed by investors behind SoundCloud, EyeEm and Clara. Our mission is to build intelligent products based on business vehicle data. You can find more on our website: http://vimcar.de 

We are looking for a great **Frontend Developer** to join our team and work on our next client side web applications (based on Flux and React).

## Frontend Developer Coding Challenge
Thank you very much for your interest in Vimcar! 

To get to know you a little better, show off your skills in our frontend coding challenge. Please send your results to jobs@vimcar.com or create a pull request or use any other channel, if we are already in contact.

### The Challenge: A "Reason" Management Tool
Have a look at this full featured (create, delete, search) [click dummy](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/AC4105VQ3) of a "reason" management tool. Something that could be required in our browser based logbook management app, where users can assign trips to a specific category and reason: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/AC4105VQ3

### Your Task

Create a full functional JavaScript application (preferably using Flux and React) which looks exactly like the [click dummy](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/AC4105VQ3) and provides the same functionality:
- create new reasons
- delete existing reasons
- search for existing reasons
- hovering over a reason shows the full text

You don't need to connect the app to an external API, just use localStorage to persist and search the created reasons.

### What we'd like to see
- clear, structured, consistent code that follows best practices
- a pixel perfect implementation of the [click dummy](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/AC4105VQ3)

### This would really impress us (but is optional)
- a full build stack with Gulp or Grunt
- pre-processed CSS (SASS or LESS)
- responsive design
- tests
